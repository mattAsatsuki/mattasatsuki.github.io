        That's right. If you use inspect element on this, you'll also find the sources I used to build this website. One of them is
        <em>4chan, </em>
        funnily enough. Just as a disclaimer, I do not usually work on frontend; however, I do have extensive experience in graphic design and corporate communication.

        Mainly, I'm an electrical engineer. I used to (and still do, from time to time) work on solar-powered electric vehicles in integrated systems and software development with the
        <a href="https://www.seattlesolarcarteam.org">Seattle Solar Car Team.</a>
        I also worked on data management and analysis for a while with them. Nowadays, I get invested in product development and testing while working on recompiling on the side.

        Though not related to my work on GitHub, I've also worked (and have continued to work) on projects as a chemical specialist for experimental greenhouse gas emission reduction systems. Specifically, the process of cycloaddition and the scalability of a helicoidal reactor. Just thought that was interesting.

        Recently, I have been studying robotics, circuitry, and a little bit of Artificial Intelligence. I will hopefully be able to push a project including these skills soon enough.
